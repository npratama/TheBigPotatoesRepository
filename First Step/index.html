        <h4 style="color:#FFB8B8;">ü•¶And so the story begins...ü•¶</h4>

        <p>
            One day, Potato and Chips were lying flat on the wheel after their midnight run, panting. All of a sudden, Chips decided to ask Potato a question, IN ENGLISH.
            <div>Here is how their conversation went :~</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>
                <div><strong>Chips :</strong> Do you like the smell of bread?</div>
                <div><strong>Potato :</strong> The smell of bed?</div>
                <div><strong>Chips :</strong> Yes, the smell of bread. You know when you walk into the bread shop, there's such a nice smell?</div>
                <div><strong>Potato :</strong> Umm... I haven't walked into a bed shop before.</div>
                <div><strong>Chips :</strong> Then who usually buys your bread for you?</div>
                <div><strong>Potato :</strong> Nobody. The bed came with this house when this house was bought.</div>
                <div><strong>Chips :</strong> Umm...huh?</div>
                <div><strong>Potato :</strong> I guess the last time I've had this bed was since I was 7 hooman years old. <strong>(Potato is now 21 hooman years old)</strong></div>
                <div><strong>Chips :</strong> You've had the same loaf of bread for...14 years?</div>
                <div><strong>Potato :</strong> Umm...it's still a good bed.</div>
                <div><strong>Chips :</strong> How are you still alive after eating that?</div>
                <div><strong>Potato :</strong> Umm...? Eat what? My bed?</div>
            </em>

            <h4 style="color:#FFB8B8;">ü•¶A moment of silence passes as the 2 stare at each other...and suddenly they both burst out squeak laughing.ü•¶</h4>

            <em>
                <div><strong>Potato :</strong> YOU MEAN BREAD, NOT BED!</div>
                <div><strong>Chips :</strong> YES I SAID BREAED RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING!</div>
                <div><strong>Potato :</strong> NO WONDER YOU ASKED ME IF I LIKED THE SMELL OF BREAD, I WAS THINKING WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME IF I LIKE THE SMELL OF BEDS!</div>
                <div><strong>Chips :</strong> YES AND YOU EVEN SAID YOUR BREAD CAME WITH THE HOUSE SINCE YOU WERE 7 HOOMAN YEARS OLD!</div>
                <div><strong>Potato :</strong> *SQUEAK* *SQUEAK* *SQUEAK* HOW CAN I BE EATING BREAD THAT IS 14 YEARS OLD!</div>
                <div><strong>Chips :</strong> EXACTLY!</div>
            </em>

            <h4 style="color:#FFB8B8;">ü•¶And thus, their silly, meaningless conversation came to an end, and they both curled up over their pee spots and fell asleep.ü•¶</h4>
